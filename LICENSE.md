# Cardinal Horizon phpVMS Module Software License

## Preamble

This license agreement has been created with the goal of addressing the following concerns:

* Licensing software for source accessible software (i.e. php is a interpreted language) when DRM and encryption are 
practically impossible or too expensive to implement.
* The needs to modify the software to best suit the user with enough protections in place to prevent those modifications
and software from being redistributed.

To make it simple to read and understand, the license agreement has been broken down into a more "question and answer"
format. The examples provided do not constitute all the situations that may be encountered for a specific clause in the
agreement, and therefore are only intended as guidance.

If you have any questions, feel free to email taylor@cardinalhorizon.com.
